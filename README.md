# InstagramColorPaletteCreator


The purpose of this project is to replicate one that already exists.

Namely the goal is to create a tool that is able to take an image and attach it's corresponding palette. This is similar to: https://twitter.com/cinemapalettes?lang=en

To achieve this goal I am using another well known project, ColorThief. The original project can be found here: https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/

Thank you Lokesh Dhakar for a wonderful tool.

The specific version of Color Thief we are using can be found here: https://github.com/SvenWoltmann/color-thief-java

Thank you Sven Woltmann for a great java implementation of the tool.

Moreover this project makes use of the Processing Library. Information on the Processing Project can be found at: https://processing.org <br />

Thank you for the team that helps to develop it! <br />

The goals of this project are to:
 
* Extract the color palette of a photo [✔️]
* Add the color palette to the bottom / side of the frame [✔️]
* Rescale so it fits on Instagram automatically [✔️]
